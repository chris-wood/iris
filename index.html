        <p>
            iris is a CCNx 1.0 forwarder with the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>CCNx 1.0 specification compatability (i.e., correct Interest, Content Object, and Interest Return forwarding).</li>
                <li>UDP and TCP links (layer 2 Ethernet is not supported).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The following features are currently in progress:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>FLIC manifest support with pre-fetching capabilities.</li>
            <li>Optional response signature verification.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            iris is not meant to be a high performance forwarder. It was built for
            two reasons: (a) to learn Rust and (b) to aid academic research projects
            at UC Irvine. To that end, I will try to keep it up to date so long
            as my research activity requires it. Going forward, I cannot make any
            promises about interoperability with other existing forwarders, e.g.,
            the <a href="https://github.com/PARC/Athena/">PARC CCNx Athena forwarder</a>.

        <h3><a id="control" class="anchor" href="#control" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>irisctl</h3>
        <p>
            iris is controlled with a program called irisctl (iris control). This is
            used to perform tasks such as creating passive link listeners, active
            link connections, and managing FIB routes. Please consult the program
            executable for comprehensive usage information (i.e., run `irisctl --help`).
        </p>

        <h3><a id="packet-flow" class="anchor" href="#packet-flow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Packet Flow</h3>

        <p>
          iris uses the Rust mio asynchronous I/O library to read and write data from and to the network.
          Each packet invokes the processing pipeline shown in the figure below.

        <h3><a id="contrib" class="anchor" href="#contrib" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h3>

        <p>
          As previously mentioned, iris was developed to aid my personal research.
          I will update it as needed. However, I would openly welcome any contributions
          to improve the design, implementation, or documentation. I'm not picky about
          the format of contributions (i.e., email patches would work fine), but Github
          pull requests would probably be easiest for everyone involved.
